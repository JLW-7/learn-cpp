# Learn C++

This repo is a collection of my notes/code for learning C++ and preparing for USACO.

> [!NOTE]
> The code you're seeing is written by 13 year old and is of course not perfect. If anything seems wrong, feel free to fork and contribute. Please also show some support by starring the project :)


## More Information

### Classification
Most of the code (except for the USACO-related folders) contain solutions I've written to programming problems from the [OpenJudge](http://openjudge.cn/) platform. Code related to or using a certain topic is classified under the folder with the corresponding topic name. 

### Learning Code
Under every folder is a "learning code" I made, titled `intro-to-<folder_name>.cpp`, teaching basics of the topic using both code and comments. For example, under the `Arrays` folder, there is the `intro-to-arrays.cpp`.

### USACO
My solutions to past USACO problems or similar competitive programming problems can be found in the `USACO Practice` folder. Most of the problems are from [usaco.guide](https://usaco.guide/), [the USACO website's training page](https://usaco.org/index.php?page=training), [CSES](https://cses.fi/), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), or [OpenJudge](http://openjudge.cn/), and are classified correspondingly.

The `USACO` folder houses code I wrote for USACO problems in actual contests.


## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by:
- Forking this repo and adding more solutions to more problems
- **Have a problem request?** Make an issue!

I'm also currently working to add a commmented header above every code snippet that includes the problem's name, link and description. If it's from a contest like USACO, the date, contest number, problem number and level would also help. For example, something like this:
```
// Name: Chip Exchange
// Link: https://usaco.org/index.php?page=season26contest1results
// Date: 2026
// Contest: 1
// Problem: 1
// Level: Bronze
```
I would appreciate any help from fellow competitive programmers!
